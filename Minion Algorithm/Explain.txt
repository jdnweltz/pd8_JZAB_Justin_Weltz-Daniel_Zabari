This algorithm should work recursively.  Imagine it as a character spawned somewhere at the edge of the board, called EXIT. EXIT moves between one and four spaces in the smae direction, before choosing a new one.  In acting, it turns the space it stands on into the exit path.  Then, there is a certain percent chance that it sends out DUMMY Minions in up to three directions.  These DUMMY Minions plant fake paths that do not truly lead to the exit.  The DUMMY Minions act in much the same way as EXIT, except that they have a chance of dying after every time they advance a space.  EXIT continues until it reaches the other side, at whihc time it stops.
