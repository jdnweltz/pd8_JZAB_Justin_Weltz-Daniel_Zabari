Began developing Maze-creating algorithm.  Implemented seperate Dummy paths and Exit Paths.
Maze is created thorugh set of recursive calls and always has a guaranteed exit.  Wrote transform method, which transforms symbols to whitespace.
Created 4 cases for 4 different corners.  Caused edges to reflect (change case) which we then determined breaks the code.
We either get errors or pretty cool mazes.

realized that the broken code was the result of a reflection at the very beginning and also changed the transformation if statemnet to accomadate the exit path.

Set to print only case 1, fixed some missing parens? fixed the column 0 row 0 problem, changed dummy path percentages, still not perfect.  Updated gitignore to ignore backup files and Maze.txt.

Marked up Case 0 with clear-ish comments.  Attempted to overcome startCounter with clever algorithmic approach but did not succeed (yet).  Code should run fine.
