Began developing Maze-creating algorithm.  Implemented seperate Dummy paths and Exit Paths.
Maze is created thorugh set of recursive calls and always has a guaranteed exit.  Wrote transform method, which transforms symbols to whitespace.
Created 4 cases for 4 different corners.  Caused edges to reflect (change case) which we then determined breaks the code.
We either get errors or pretty cool mazes.

realized that the broken code was the result of a reflection at the very beginning and also changed the transformation if statemnet to accomadate the exit path.
