Began developing Maze-creating algorithm.  Implemented separate Dummy paths and Exit Paths.
Maze is created thorough set of recursive calls and always has a guaranteed exit.  Wrote transform method, which transforms symbols to whitespace.
Created 4 cases for 4 different corners.  Caused edges to reflect (change case) which we then determined breaks the code.
We either get errors or pretty cool mazes.

realized that the broken code was the result of a reflection at the very beginning and also changed the transformation if statement to accommodate the exit path. The maze will now always be solvable. Added the startCount variable.

Added the dummy percentages and fixed the calls to dummy paths to accommodate this change. Tested out multiple percentages. Hard to get it right. Changes the size of the array in order to accommodate the reflection property.

Set to print only case 1, fixed some missing parens? fixed the column 0 row 0 problem, changed dummy path percentages, still not perfect.  Updated gitignore to ignore backup files and Maze.txt.

played with expanding the amount of dummy paths created in order to make the maze more interesting. Played with percentages in order to make the dummy paths expand at random points.

Marked up Case 0 with clear-ish comments.  Attempted to overcome startCounter with clever algorithmic approach but did not succeed (yet).  Code should run fine.

Major overhaul of code. Numbers instead of chars. More details if it works.

2014-05-30 (Justin)
tried to implement numbers part. But it didn't work so I will throw out a lot of the code.

Thought up an algorithm, began implementing.  Explanation stored in new folder. 

2014-06-02 (Justin)
Started implementing a totally different algorithm- based on putting a path where it doesn’t touch another path.

2014-06-03 (Daniel)
Minor changes.

2014-06-03 (Justin)
Finished the algorithm but realize I was implementing the the recursion incorrectly.

2014-06-06 (Daniel)
Getting better idea of how algorithm will map out.

2014-06-06 (Justin)
fixed the recursion issues

2014-06–07 (Justin)
algorithm seems to work, but hard to tell because of letter issues

2014-06-08 (Justin)
worked out a couple problems - created a case and an opening as well as an exit - now done with my algorithm

2014-06-11 (Justin)
made the character for the walls different- fixed the problem with the file - we weren’t closing it- and created the beginnings of the master Driver class.

2014-06-11 (Justin)
Added the Maze Solver so I can display a solution

2014-06-11 (Justin)
Modified the maze solver to fit my maze - modified the Driver to print out a solution and create a text file with the solution in it.
